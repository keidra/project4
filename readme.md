Process

My initial approach was to get the backend of my application working first, before I started working on the front-end. 
I started with the routing, and setting up my database to put information onto the page. 

Issues/Unsolved Problems

I had some issues getting the table to work with Heroku & mLabs, but was able to get everything pushed and working with some help from TAs and a classmate. 
I also had a slight issue getting my favorites page to work, but finally got it working. 
An unsolved problem the application has right now, is that after you delete a favorite the page needs to be reloaded before the changes
are seen on the page. I have implemented a hack to reload the page on click, and delete at the same time.
